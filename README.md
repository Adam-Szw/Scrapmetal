How to setup for development or viewing in Unity:

Install git and set it up
Install Unity. Make sure that you have the 2D games package
Open Unity Hub. Create an empty project. Select 2D game as template
Wait for Unity to create the files for your project, then close Unity Hub and the project
Create an empty folder somewhere else
Open command line (On Windows type in 'cmd' in search bar)
Navigate to the new folder
Type 'git clone https://campus.cs.le.ac.uk/gitlab/aks60/third-year-project.git'
Once the files are downloaded close the command line
Cut all files from this folder into our Unity project folder
Replace all files with new ones
Remove temporary folder (now should be empty)
Open Unity Hub and see that the project is now setup
